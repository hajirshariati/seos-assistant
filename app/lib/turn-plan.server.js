// products should be displayed, and what shape the answer must take.
//
// This replaces the scattered per-screenshot rules (occasion remaps, gender
// gates, "should I suppress cards", "force a lookup") with one place that
// decides. The plan is injected into the system prompt so the LLM-owns-turn

// so it is fully unit-testable; the caller passes in the signals it needs.

//   1. policy_account       — returns/refunds/shipping/order/account

//   4. named_product_advisory — named product + worth/suitability/condition
//   5. condition_recommendation — condition/use-case (± category) "what do you recommend"
//   6. browse               — "show me X", plain product search
